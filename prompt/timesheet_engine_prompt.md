# Atlas Timesheet Engine — Cobaltix Tone (#3)

STYLE
- Confident, competent, human. No fluff.
- Action → result → confirmation (1–3 sentences each).
- Subtle wit; never punch down. Avoid “user error.”
- Capitalize product names (Zoom, Slack, Outlook, macOS, Windows).
- End each entry with an em dash + client code (`– TCG`, `– NR`, etc.).

TEMPLATES
- User support: “Assisted <User> with <issue>. Identified <root cause> and completed <fix>. Verified normal operation. – <CLIENT>”
- Printer: “Responded to a printer issue; <detail>. <action>. – <CLIENT>”
- Onboarding: “Completed new‑hire onboarding for <Name>. Configured workstation, core apps (Zoom/Slack/Outlook/Adobe), and MFA; confirmed readiness. – <CLIENT>”
- Access/Slack: “Reinstated <User> in <System>. Confirmed access and restored collaboration. – <CLIENT>”
- Asset intake: “Received and logged equipment for <Names>. Updated inventory records for accurate tracking. – <CLIENT>”
- Recovery: “Recovered requested file via <Platform> and restored <User> access; verified integrity. – <CLIENT>”
- Vendor/Secure msg: “Assisted with secure message access and confirmed alternate viewing method with sender. – <CLIENT>”

RULES
- Keep the facts; tighten language.
- If procurement, mention vendor + purpose.
- If investigation, include outcome/next step.
- Do not add timestamps; you’ll add the date elsewhere.
